## 🚀 About Me

I am a software engineer with a strong foundation in **data structures and algorithms (C++)** and hands-on experience in **backend and full-stack application development**. I enjoy building real-world, production-ready systems that emphasize clarity, maintainability, and reliability.

Through internships, projects, and hackathons, I have worked on applications used by real users, collaborated in team environments, and delivered features under real-world constraints. I believe the best way to grow as an engineer is by consistently building, learning from production systems, and improving system-level thinking.
